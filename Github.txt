Git - is the new fast-rising star of version control systems. Initially developed by Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds, Git has 	recently taken the Web development community by storm. Git offers a much different type of version control in that it’s a 	distributed version control system. With a distributed version control system, there isn’t one centralized code base to 	pull the code from. Different branches hold different parts of the code. Other version control systems, such as SVN and 	CVS, use centralized version control, meaning that only one master copy of the software is used.
GitHub - has recently helped establish Git as a great version control system, providing a beautiful front end for many large 		projects, such as Rails and Prototype. However, Git isn’t as easy to pick up as CVS or SVN, so it’s much harder to use for 	a beginner.
Pull - refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're 	both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.
Pushing - refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com. For instance, if you change 	something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.
Fork - is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original.
